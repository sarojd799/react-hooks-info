1.When component is rending twice check if there is react strict mode enabled
2. use state is called each time state updates also during initial render so better  to use a  
callback function to initialize the value rather than to use a value directly
3.in use-effect hook if  you don't pass second argument then it will run on each side effect
4.in use-effect hook  if you pass empty array then it will only run on mount and if you pass 
any value to the array of the second argument then each side effect of variable will cause use-effect call
